	<h1>First Section Heading</h1>

	<p>Here is the first paragraph, containing text that
	really <span id="makeRed">doesn't have any use or
	meaning</span>; it just prattles on and on,with no end
	whatsoever, no point to make, really no purpose for existence
	at all.</p>

	<h1>What book is this from?</h1>

	<p>Call me Ishmael. Some years ago - never mind how long
	precisely - having little or no money in my purse, and nothing
	particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail
	about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a
	way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the
	circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the
	mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul;
	whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin
	warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet;
	and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me,
	that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from
	deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically
	knocking people's hats off - then, I account it high time to
	get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol
	and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself
	upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing
	surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in
	their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same
	feelings towards the ocean with me.</p>
